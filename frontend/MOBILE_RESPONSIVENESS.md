/* Mobile: 0-640px */
/* Small: 641px-768px */
/* Medium: 769px-1024px */
/* Large: 1025px-1280px */
/* Extra Large: 1281px+ */
```

### 3. Grid System
- **Mobile**: Single column layouts
- **Tablet**: 2-column layouts where appropriate
- **Desktop**: Multi-column layouts

### 4. Typography Scale
- **Mobile**: Smaller font sizes for better fit
- **Desktop**: Larger font sizes for better readability

// Mobile navigation
{isMobile && (
  <Sheet>
    {/* Mobile menu */}
  </Sheet>
)}

// Desktop navigation
{!isMobile && (
  <nav>
    {/* Desktop menu */}
  </nav>
)}
```
